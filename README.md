# Sorting algorithm visualizer
___
## Description
This program visualizes how sorting algorithms work using the Swing library.

The data to sort gets automatically generated,
but you can also generate a new set of data by clicking the "Generate" button.
You can also set the desired speed of algorithm execution (set to 30 millis by default).

At the moment it supports 3 types of sorting algorithms:
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Bubble sort

## TODO
- [ ] Add more sorting algorithms,
- [ ] Fix a Bubble sort bug where if you click the "Generate" button during the sorting process the whole program hangs
